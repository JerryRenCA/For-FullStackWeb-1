MVVM Overview - my understanding.

1>  What is MVVM?
    A: MVVM is a strategy to organize code and logistic when coding, Model-View-ViewModel.
2>  Difference with MVC?
    A:  In MVC, controller is the key/transfer point in this design model. It
sends views to user, and get input from views to update models. Meanwhile, views will
get data through controllers too. 
        In MVVM, viewmodel is the key point. It supplies data for views, then views
could show users these data. At the same time, view could update viewmodel, then viewmodel update 
related models.
3>  Pros and cons for MVVM for web development?
    A:  Pros:
        a>  Simplify business logic in front-end, just grab the viewmodel data and update models 
based on its methods.
        b>  Good for unit testing. Viewmodel is a good point to implement tests for the both sides.
        c>  MVVM might be helpful to reduce code lines, but it will increase the amount of data transfered.
        Cons:
        a>  MVVM will couple front-end with server-end more than MVC. They both have to use same viewmodel.
        b>  Viewmodel is heavy for small requests.
4>  A understand to MVVM and MVC
    A:  For single page applications, MVVM could be better at some situations.
        For multi-pages, multi-components applications, application based on MVC could be easier to de built.
It could keep server-end as simple as possible. Interfaces between front-end and server-end could be simpler.
5>  Advantages of MVP
    A: MVP could refresh views when model changed. In MVC, it could be implmented by microservices.
